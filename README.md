flour, a CakePHP Plugin
==========

flour is a plugin for CakePHP that acts as a toolset for application developers. It has been actively developed, and used in production by many, since early 2009.

Created by [Dirk Br√ºnsicke][1], flour is still under heavy development, but can boost your application development time within CakePHP. To use it effectively, you have
to understand the basic principle of how things work. First, there is a schedule  

CakePHP up to the latest version 1.3 is supported.

Design Goals
------------
 * CMSes suck.  We don't want our application to live inside a CMS.
 * Do one thing and do it well. flour schedules content.  That's pretty much it.
 * Don't be clever.  We're not clever so we probably can't make a computer clever.
 * Be fast.  Cache in flour so that the consuming application doesn't have to.

Terminology
-----------
### Plate
A *Plate* is a class of content.  A plate is identified by the combination of it's *Layout Name*, *Instance Name* and *Plate Name*.  The names are used to classify and organize plates.

### Layout Name
A class of pages.  For instance, the layout for all help pages.

### Instance Name
A specific page using a layout.  For instance, the contact help page.  The Instance Name can be blank for those layouts that have only one instance, such as a home page.

### Plate Name
A content area on a web page.  For instance, the body of the contact help page.

### Plate Edition
A *Plate* has many *Plate Editions*.  These editions contain content and can be scheduled.

### Fallback Edition
The edition that is published if no scheduled edition can be found.

### Publish
Flag used to mark that an edition is ready to be considered for publishing.  Scheduling rules will take this edition into account.

### Event
*Plate Editions* can be grouped into *Events* that can be scheduled.  All editions take on the Events start time and and time.

### Plate Set
A *Plate Set* is a template for generating a group of related *Plates*.  For example, if a help page has a body plate and a left column plate, a user can generate an instance of both those plates from that plate set.

### Consuming App
The application that makes web calls out to rit. for content.


Scheduling
----------

### Conflicts
When there are scheduling conflicts for multiple editions of the same content, the *start time* is used to determine which plate gets published.  The event latest start time takes priority.  

If start multiple editions have the same start time, the most recently modified edition takes priority
